> **Short Self Note:**
> I am very proud of myself completing this course. It wasn't easy. I managed to complete it in a short period of time, and solved all the homework problems.
> I definitely learned a lot from this course. before, I was afraid from graph problems but I learned: if I work systematically, I can manage the complexity of a problem and solve it piece by piece.
> definitely convincing myself to learn BSL language for this course was a not easy, but worth the outcome.
> Now my job is to adopt the systematic design principles and lesson that I learn, and implement them in my coding practices.
