> I have always hate networking and thought it is an extremely sophisticated concept to learn. I realized, I never learned it fundamentally. This is a great resource to lay the foundations to study more advanced concepts related to networking. If you just want to develop websites or create a socket in your application, knowing this knowledge will help you better understand the underlying teach stack that you are working with.
